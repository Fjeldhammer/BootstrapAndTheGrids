                        <p>Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.</p>
                        <p>As you wish. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</p>
                        <p>I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.</p>
                        <p>Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! What!? I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</p>
                        <p>What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more likeâ€¦suicide. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.</p>
                        <p>You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</p>
                        <p>Don't underestimate the Force. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.</p>
                        <p>Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.</p>                            
                        <p>Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</p>
                        <p>I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.</p>
