                        <p>We found them. On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. Found them? In Mercia?! The coconut's tropical! Well, how'd you become king, then? What do you mean?
                            Well, how'd you become king, then? Why? Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! I am your king. We found them.
                            What do you mean? It's only a model. And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place.
                            Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! And the hat. She's a witch! Camelot! Well, Mercia's a temperate zone!
                            Burn her anyway! Bloody Peasant! Bloody Peasant! Well, I got better.
                            And the hat. She's a witch! On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. Found them? In Mercia?! The coconut's tropical! I am your king. Found them? In Mercia?! The coconut's tropical!
                            Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. Shut up! Will you shut up?! The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.
                            Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! Oh, ow! Well, how'd you become king, then? Well, I didn't vote for you. Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system!
                            I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time! The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice!
                            Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony. Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system!
                            I'm not a witch. What a strange person. Shut up! Will you shut up?! Well, what do you want? I dunno. Must be a king.

                            We want a shrubbery!! What a strange person. We found them. You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!
                            We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.
                            Well, we did do the nose. Well, what do you want? Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! He hasn't got shit all over him.

                            What a strange person. Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! I dunno. Must be a king. What do you mean? It's only a model.
                            Well, I didn't vote for you. You don't vote for kings. How do you know she is a witch? What do you mean? I dunno. Must be a king.
                            Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. Where'd you get the coconuts? I'm not a witch. Burn her! Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! Why?
